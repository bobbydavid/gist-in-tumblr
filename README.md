Embed Gists in Tumblr
=====================

Scripts to embed Gists in your Tumblr blog.

How it works
------------

This is mostly a hack-job of
[jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) and
[writeCapture](https://github.com/iamnoah/writeCapture), and
inspired by [this gist](https://gist.github.com/2506180).


Installation
------------

The fastest way to install is simply to paste this code into your
Tumblr blog, in the <head> section. For most themes, this can be
accomplished by clicking "Customize" and then pasting the following
into the "Description" field:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://github.com/downloads/iamnoah/writeCapture/jquery.writeCapture-1.0.5-min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="<TODO: SCRIPT HERE>?"></script>

If you already have jQuery somewhere, then you do not need the first link.


License
-------

Owing to writeCapture being licensed under GPL, this software is under the
same.
